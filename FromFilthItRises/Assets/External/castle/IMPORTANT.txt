Thank you for purchasing The Big Castle Kit. I hope you like it and it fits your needs.

Please use the following project settings when using The Big Castle Kit

Edit->Project Settings->Player->Other Settings/Rendering
Set the Color Space to "Linear"

Edit->Project Settings->Graphics->Tier Settings
Set the Rendering Path to "Deferred"

To achieve the same visuals as shown in the screenshots install the Post Processing stack via the the Windows->Packet Manager. 
Follow the Unity docs to set up the Postprocessing stack: https://unity3d.com/how-to/set-up-post-processing-stack
You find the arcording profiles under scenes/scene*Profiles
Bake the lighting using Realtime Global Illumination. 

I reduced the size of many textures in this pack to decrease the download time. Contact us for a HiRes Texture Pack.
